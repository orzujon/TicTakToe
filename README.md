# TicTakToe
Console Based TikTakToe game

This a traditional Tik Tac Toe game created in Java. The learning outcomes from completing the application is using arraylist, list, random and scanner functions. 

Improvements that can be explored further are adding AI movements instead of using random choise for computer as an opponent. 

The first attempt I did was a console based TicTacToe which indicated the locations of X as a user input and O is a random Computer inputs. It looks like this:

It asks user to input the location of their move by indicating them in number orders between range in 1 to 9;

Once the user does their input then random move comes from the computer and the move will be passed to the user again<img width="312" alt="TIc-Tak-Toe_2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100639316/194839971-55af09cd-2cd8-4228-bf3b-294c3fd01d98.png">
